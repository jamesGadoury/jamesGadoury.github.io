## notes for self

With venv configured from requirements.txt, run the generate.py script. 

Ensure that each post in ./posts has the following structure (the `---` are required delimiters):

```
---
title: <TITLE> 
date: XXXX-XX-XX
Tags: [<TAGS...>]
---

<CONTENT...>
```

To see the website you have to start an http server in the `docs` dir. From base dir:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000 -d docs
```
