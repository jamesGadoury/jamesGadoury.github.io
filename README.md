## blog integration with pelican

Below are the steps for my pelican setup. Saving here for my own reference :sweatsmile:, but also could be helpful to others for their websites.

To generate and integrate your blog posts into the website, follow these steps:

1. **Install Pelican and Markdown**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then install Pelican and Markdown:
   ```bash
   pip install pelican markdown
   ```

2. **Setup Your Content**  
   Create a `content/` directory in the project root. This is where you'll store your blog posts in Markdown format. For example, create a file `content/my-first-post.md` with the following content:
   ```markdown
   Title: My First Post
   Date: 2025-04-06
   Category: Blog
   Tags: pelican, example
   Slug: my-first-post
   Authors: James Gadoury

   Welcome to my first blog post generated by Pelican. This is a sample post to demonstrate how to write your blog entries in Markdown.
   ```

3. **Configure Pelican**  
   Create a configuration file named `pelicanconf.py` in the project root with your desired settings. Here is a sample configuration:
   ```python
   AUTHOR = 'James Gadoury'
   SITENAME = 'James Gadoury Blog'
   SITEURL = ''

   PATH = 'content'

   TIMEZONE = 'America/New_York'
   DEFAULT_LANG = 'en'

   # Feed generation is usually not desired when developing
   FEED_ALL_ATOM = None
   CATEGORY_FEED_ATOM = None
   TRANSLATION_FEED_ATOM = None
   AUTHOR_FEED_ATOM = None
   AUTHOR_FEED_RSS = None

   DEFAULT_PAGINATION = 10

   # Set a theme for your blog
   THEME = 'pelican-themes/simple'
   ```

4. **Generate the Blog**  
   Run Pelican to generate the static blog site. This command will output the blog files into a new `blog/` directory:
   ```bash
   pelican content -o blog -s pelicanconf.py
   ```

5. **Deploy**  
   Ensure that the generated `blog/` folder is placed alongside your existing website files. Your main page (`index.html`) includes a link to the blog at `./blog/index.html`.

6. **Update the Homepage**  
   If you haven't already, update your `index.html` to include a link to your blog. For example, add:
   ```html
   <div id="blog-link">
       <a href="./blog/index.html" style="font-family: 'Orbitron', sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em; color: rgb(235, 52, 146); text-decoration: none;">Visit My Blog</a>
   </div>
   ```
   Make sure to update any necessary CSS in your `css/style.css` to style the new blog link.
