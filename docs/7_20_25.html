    <div class="content">
        <p>Recently I acquired a <a href="https://www.clockworkpi.com/picocalc">picocalc</a>, a portable device that comes
with <a href="https://geoffg.net/picomite.html">picomite</a> pre-installed. Admittedly, I bought it because
it looked cool, and did roughly zero research into what you could actually do with it. The picomite
firmware has a MMBasic interpreter, so I figured I would play around with programming on it.
Having never programmed in MMBasic (let alone BASIC) before, it took me a while to get the hang of <a href="https://geoffg.net/Downloads/picomite/PicoMite_User_Manual.pdf">the syntax</a>.
The first project I have built on this is a simple paddle game (which took me a much longer time than I care to admit).
Here's the <a href="https://github.com/jamesGadoury/picocalc-projects/blob/e3b130988c6b75dfb3b5289c8413e752f08138d4/src/paddle.bas">source code if interested</a>.</p>
<p>One difficulty I ran into was the lack of access to my github account on the picocalc. I'm used
to setting up a local git repo almost immediately after starting any new project or using my "catch all" private
repo that I use to track random projects. As a somewhat neurotic person, I will add and commit just
about any set of small changes (with helpful commit messages such as "works") on a dev branch about every 2-20 minutes when
doing focused work.</p>
<p>A cool feature of the picocalc is that you can connect it to a computer using its usb-c port and communicate
serially with that computer using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM">xmodem protocol</a>. This has allowed
me to follow a relatively fun development process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Play around with the picocalc, get some simple proof of concept working.</li>
<li>Send the relevant file(s) from my picocalc to to one of my dev machines (e.g. laptop or computer).</li>
<li>Add the file(s) to source control on my dev machine.</li>
<li>Do some quick cleanup / refactoring on my dev machine, maybe implement a feature or two.</li>
<li>Send the relevant file(s) from my dev machine back to my picocalc.</li>
<li>Test the updated code. Fix any syntax errors or bugs.</li>
<li>Repeat process starting at step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>This has been a fun blend of getting to play around with the BASIC programming language on a convenient handheld,
and also being able to use my dev machine for larger changes (using a more comfortable keyboard and neovim). Also,
I can use git. Working on software without source control is insane.</p>
<p>Here's how I do the file transfers.</p>
<h2>Picocom &amp; XMODEM</h2>
<p>First of all, you have to install picocom. I almost exclusively use ubuntu (the exception being when I'm forced to use something else by higher powers),
so all of these steps are what I do on ubuntu 24.</p>
<p>Install picocom (I'd rather not include this, it seems obvious üòÖ; but here you go)</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install picocom lrzsz
</code></pre>

<p>With your picocalc connected to your dev machine, you then can find the device file by:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash"># on your dev machine
ls /dev/serial/by-id
</code></pre>

<p>This will output whatever serial devices that are connected to your machine. If you see multiple devices
after running the above command, you can try disconnecting your picocalc, re-running the command; and whichever
device file name is missing is likely your picocalc.</p>
<p>Now that you have the device file name, you can start picocom (with DEVICEPATH being the full path to your serial device):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash">picocom \
    --baud 115200 \
    --parity n \
    --stopbits 1 \
    --flow h \
    --receive-cmd &quot;rx -vv&quot; \
    --send-cmd &quot;sx -vv&quot; \
    DEVICEPATH
</code></pre>

<p>For example, this is what I run:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash">picocom \
--baud 115200\
--parity n \
--stopbits 1 \
--flow h \
--receive-cmd &quot;rx -vv&quot; \
--send-cmd &quot;sx -vv&quot; \
/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes I run into weird issues when sending/receiving to/from my picocalc &amp; dev machine. I have found that
changing the <code>--flow h</code> command to <code>--flow n</code> makes it always work.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash">picocom --baud 115200 \
--parity n \
--stopbits 1 \
--flow n \
--receive-cmd &quot;rx -vv&quot; \
--send-cmd &quot;sx -vv&quot; \
/dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between the arg values is <code>--flow h</code> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data)#Hardware_flow_control">hardware flow control</a>
and <code>--flow n</code> uses no flow control. Based on the wikipedia page for flow control, it seems better to have it
than not; but anecdotally I have yet to run into any issues running without flow control.</p>
<p>Now with the picocom terminal connected to our picocalc, we can send and receive files.</p>
<h3>Sending files from picocalc to dev machine</h3>
<p>On the picocalc enter the following command (replace FILEPATH with the file you want to send from picocalc):</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-BASIC">XMODEM SEND FILEPATH 
</code></pre>

<p>On your dev machine, with picocom open, you can type (and hold) Ctrl+a+r.
You should then see a prompt for <code>file:</code>.
Type in the path FILEPATH you want to save the received file to.</p>
<p><em>NOTE that you do not have to use the same name as the file you are sending from picocalc.</em></p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash">*** file: FILEPATH 
</code></pre>

<p>If all worked out, you should then see the file at whatever path you gave the above command.</p>
<h3>Sending files from dev machine to picocalc</h3>
<p>On your desktop, with picocom open, you can run the send command with ‚ÄúCtrl+a+s‚Äù.
You should see a similar <code>file:</code> prompt as you did when executing the receive command in picocom.
Enter the file path FILEPATH of the file from your filesystem that you want to send to picocalc:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-bash">*** file: FILEPATH 
</code></pre>

<p>On your picocalc run the following (where FILEPATH) is the path you want to save the file to.</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-BASIC">XMODEM RECEIVE FILEPATH
</code></pre>

<p>Similiarly to the process for sending files from picocalc to dev machine, the receiver does not
need to specify the same filename/path as the sender. Whatever file is sent by the sender will get
saved as whatever the receiver specifies it should be saved as.</p>
<p>If the above works out, you should now see the file on your picocalc (with whatever path you specified).</p>
