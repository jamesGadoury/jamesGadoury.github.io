Today I'm starting a blog.

I work at amazon robotics, generally as a dev and roboticist.
My current focus is on robotic perception & task/action planning.
I also do a fair amount of lower level (in terms of abstraction) dev for work,
including configuring networks, writing services that interact with hardware, and other deeply frustrating things.

I plan on writing about things I'm interested.
I aim to keep the posts / articles at roughly the length of my attention span.

## things i'm interested in:

- manipulation
- robotics, mechatronics, electronics
- networking & middleware
- perception
- machine learning
- general autonomy, agent dev, etc

I will try to write roughly once a week, as I have stuff I think is useful. It will be concerning if I don't have something useful to share at least once a week.
