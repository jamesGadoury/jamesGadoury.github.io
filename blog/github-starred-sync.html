    <div class="content">
      <p>Recently at work I've been configuring many systemd services for devices that are running
debian bookworm. While the adoption of systemd seems to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/12sz3da/why_is_systemd_controversial/?rdt=35888">somewhat contentious</a>,
I have found it to be incredibly powerful. As such, I've been using it quite often to configure different services for linux devices on my home network.</p>
<p>One application of this is a systemd service I configured to clone &amp; pull updates from github repos I've starred on my personal account.</p>
<p>My reasoning for this is that there are many repos I'm quite fond of, and would like to keep my own personal archive backed up on my own storage.</p>
<p>I have a lightweight linux mini pc that is setup to pull starred github repos and save them to an external hdd.</p>
<p>If interested, <a href="https://github.com/jamesGadoury/github-starred-sync">all of the code is public</a>.</p>
<p>All of this repo's artifacts wwere generated entirely through chat gpt o3-mini-high and 4o (before o3 and o4-mini-high were available) with some light post processing on my end.</p>
<p>I have found that llms are very good at writing bash scripts and configuration files that I do not want to write :)</p>
