Recently at work I've been configuring many systemd services for devices that are running
debian bookworm. While the adoption of systemd seems to be [somewhat contentious](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/12sz3da/why_is_systemd_controversial/?rdt=35888),
I have found it to be incredibly powerful. As such, I've been using it quite often to configure different services for linux devices on my home network.

One application of this is a systemd service I configured to clone & pull updates from github repos I've starred on my personal account.

My reasoning for this is that there are many repos I'm quite fond of, and would like to keep my own personal archive backed up on my own storage.

I have a lightweight linux mini pc that is setup to pull starred github repos and save them to an external hdd.

If interested, [all of the code is public](https://github.com/jamesGadoury/github-starred-sync).

All of this repo's artifacts were generated entirely through chat gpt o3-mini-high and 4o (before o3 and o4-mini-high were available) with some light post processing on my end.

I have found that llms are very good at writing bash scripts and configuration files that I do not want to write :)
